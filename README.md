# ‚ö° ModBus ESP32 reader for a cheap chinese power meter

This repo details how to use a [Saola-1 ESP32S2 board](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/hw-reference/esp32s2/user-guide-saola-1-v1.2.html) coupled with [a RS485 transceiver from
LinkSprite](http://shieldlist.org/linksprite/rs485) and connect it to Espressif's IoT cloud platform: [RainMaker][rainmaker].

There are several branches, all of them with custom setups that work
with PlatformIO IDE with varying degrees of success:

## üéã Branches

* master: FreeModbus from ESP-IDF framework with PVoutput.org and RainMaker
    support.
* emodbus: [eModbus][emodbus] with Arduino, first time I got the Modbus holding registers listed thanks to [this eModbus discussion thread][emodbus_hardware_discussion].
* arduino-rainmaker: Same as emodbus, but trying to mix in RainMaker, ultimately switching to ESP-IDF (on `master`) after realising that Arduino support for RainMaker is in the works at the time of writing this.

## ü§ñ Hardware setup

The hardware setup is very similar to [this eModbus hardware example thread][emodbus_hardware_example] with a couple of notable differences:

1) The use of a [ttl level converter][ttl_level_converter] between the MAX458CPE RS485 (5V level) transceiver and the Espressif board (which is 3.3V level).
2) RE/DE circuitry is handled by the LinkSprite shield instead of [via software with `REDEPIN`][redepin]. This is because [the shield has a transistor-based automatic switching between transmitting and receiving][auto_rede].

Here's a picture at some of the hardware specs from the power meter:

## üñ•Ô∏è Code structure

The protocol used on top of RS485 is Modbus-RTU with 8N1 parity and with this code is acting as a `master` and the power meter as `master`.

* `app_modbus.c`: ModBus RTU code
* `app_rmaker.c`: RainMaker setup for parameters and updates.
* `app_time.c`: PVoutput.org time and date formatting for watts submission.
* `app_rgbled.c`: Nothing to see here, move along XD
* `platformio.ini`: Embeeded certs for RainMaker and other flashing/building goodies.

## ‚úã How can you contribute?

1. Review your own power meter's manual and find the register(s) listing.
3. Come up with a way to share this codebase with other third party (custom) ModBus power meter definitions and submit a pullrequest with [CID characteristics like mine here](https://github.com/brainstorm/yigedianqi-modbus/blob/f6a4d453bac206fb2ed3160085f9e9adee2a0960/src/app_modbus.c#L120-L161).
4. Code review, audit and clean my messy code, specially the use of global variables and **substitute it with proper FreeRTOS queues, semaphores and mutexes instead**.

## üåÄ Random notes

There are a few vague, vestigial references online about this power meter:

1. There's a [youtube][youtube_usage] video showing the default setup password and some basic usage/configuration.
2. A possible company spinoff, [from yiGedianqi to yiHedianqi][possible_company_spinoff]?
3. Several [Amazon customers rating this meter][amazon_power_meter_ratings] and pointing out that it only comes with a chinese manual (true story).
